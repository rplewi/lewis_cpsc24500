class Author{
    private LinkedHashMap<String, ArrayList<String>>() // words you can choose from;

}
One hashMap that holds each of the different types of words.
File is going to be the only thing that is going to be read, no writing to files.
words['n'] --> ArrayList<String> // all nouns
words['v'] --> ArrayList<String> // all vers
words['prep'] --> ArrayList<String> // all prepositions
words['adj'] --> ArrayList<String> // all adjectives
words['adv'] --> ArrayList<String> // all adverbs

getWord("n") --> word would be randomly selected from the list of words inside the Arraylist in this case it would be nouns.
