 ArrayList<String> uniqueWords // Keeps track of 
LinkedHashMap<String, Integer> counts // counts the occurence of words

have a loop that runs while (file.hasNextLine())\{
replaceAll(\'[//p\{Punct\}\',\'\')
use the splut function to blow it up into separate words \'97> parts array!
	foreach part in the parts array\{
	// for each word that has appeared on the line
		See if its in '93uniqueWords'94 '97> uniqueWords.contains(part) '97> true or false
		and if not, add it to uniqueWords and also ask counts to do this: counts.add(part,1)
		if it was in uniqueWords: counts.put(part, counts.get(part)+1);
	}
}
You have got a unique list of words and their occurence!\
